# README-Generator

## About this Project 
Creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

The purpose of this project is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Dependencies 
* InquirerJS 
* File system
